What is distributed version control system and explain the advantages of it?
  A distributed version control system (DVCS) brings a local copy of the complete repository to every team member’s computer so they can commit, branch, and merge locally. The server doesn’t have to store a physical file for each branch — it just needs the differences between each commit. Some advantages are reliable backup copies( a distributed version control removes the reliance on a single backup, making development more reliable, fast merging and felxible branching(A distributed version control also allows software development teams to use different branching strategies, a feature that isn’t possible with a centralized system), rapid feedback and few merge confllicts(A DVCS makes branching easy, because having an entire repository’s history on their local workstation ensures that they can quickly experiment and request a code review), and the flexibility to work offline(A distributed version control system doesn’t require an internet connection, so most development, except pushing and pulling, can be done while traveling or away from home or an office)
